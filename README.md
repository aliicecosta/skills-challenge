## Question 2
The question asked:
1. Students's names with grade bigger than 8, in descending order (DSC - highest grades first).
2. For students with the same grade, order them in alphabetical order (that means, ASC)
3. For grades lower than 8, use 'NULL' as the name, in descending order (DSC - highest grades first).
4. For students with the same grade (and less than 8), order them in ascendin order (ASC).

The question gave the following output as example:

    Maria 10 99

    Marcela 9 88

    Julia 9 81

    Andreia 8 78

    NULL 7 63

    NULL 7 68

But, as Marcela and Julia has the same grade, they shoud be order by the alphabetical order. So, the right output should be:

    Maria 10 99

    Julia 9 81

    Marcela 9 88

    Andreia 8 78

    NULL 7 63

    NULL 7 68
